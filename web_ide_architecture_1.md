# Web IDE Architecture and Technology Choices

The goal is to create a web-based development environment (Web IDE) similar to Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces. The architecture will be full-stack to support persistent file management and a live terminal connection.

## Key Components and Technologies

| Component | Technology/Protocol | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code Editor** | [**Monaco Editor**](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) | The powerful, feature-rich code editor that powers VS Code. Provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and a VS Code-like look and feel. |
| **Terminal** | [**Xterm.js**](https://xtermjs.org/) | A robust, front-end terminal emulator. It will be connected to a backend shell process (e.g., bash) via **WebSockets** for real-time, interactive command-line access. |
| **File Management** | **Custom Backend API (e.g., Flask/FastAPI)** | A server-side component to handle file system operations (read, write, create, delete, rename, list directory contents). This will interact with the sandbox's local file system. |
| **Language Features** | **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** (Future consideration) | A protocol used by VS Code and Theia for providing advanced language features (e.g., go-to-definition, refactoring). For this initial prototype, basic syntax highlighting from Monaco will suffice. |
| **Frontend Framework** | **Vanilla JS/React/Vue** (To be decided during project initialization) | A modern framework will be used to structure the UI and manage state. Given the need for a full-stack project, a simple setup will be preferred. |
| **Backend Framework** | **Node.js/Python (e.g., Express/Flask)** | To handle API requests for file operations and manage the WebSocket connection for the terminal. Given the sandbox environment, a Python-based backend (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) is a good choice. |

## Architectural Overview

The application will follow a client-server architecture:

1.  **Frontend (Browser)**: Hosts the UI, including the Monaco Editor, Xterm.js terminal, and a file tree view. It communicates with the backend via REST APIs (for file operations) and WebSockets (for the terminal).
2.  **Backend (Server)**: A server process running in the sandbox. It handles:
    *   Serving the static frontend files.
    *   Implementing the File Management API to interact with the file system (`os` and `shutil` modules in Python).
    *   Managing the interactive shell process for the terminal (using a library like `pty` in Python to create a pseudo-terminal).

This design ensures a functional, interactive development environment that closely mimics the user's request.
